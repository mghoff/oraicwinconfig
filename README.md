A Go CLI tool to install and configure [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html) on Windows 11 for use by Oracle's very own R package: [ROracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/roracle.html)

## Background

This package was built within the context of needing to install and configure for Windows the `Oracle Instant Client` package and SDK - both of which are needed by the `ROracle` package to effectively interface with Oracle databases.

`Roracle` often needs built from source, further requiring the installation of [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

`RTools` will look for the existence of the `Oracle Instant Client` package within your System or User `PATH` Environment Variables during buildtime. As such, it is imperitive that this package and its SDK be installed and properly configured on your Windows system.

This package aims to do just that.

## Requirements

  + Windows 11 OS
  + A `tnsnames.ora` file containing Oracle connection details

## Installation

### Option 1: Download the Pre-Built Binary
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mghoff/oraicwinconfig/releases) page
2. Download the latest executable file: `oraicwinconfig.exe`
3. Run the executable file and follow the prompts

### Option 2: Build from Source
Clone this repository and build using Go:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mghoff/oraicwinconfig.git
cd oraicwinconfig
.\scripts\build.cmd
```

Following a successful build, a `.\bin` folder will have been created which contains the `oraicwinconfig.exe` executable file along with a `SHA256SUMS` file. You can then run the exectuable file and follow the prompts in your command terminal.

## Details:

This executable will perform the following...
1. Download into the user's Downloads folder the Windows-specific `Oracle Instant Client Basic Lite` package and SDK zip files.
2. Unzip the above files into either the specified installation directory.
3. Add the installation directory to the `PATH` User Environment Variable.
4. Create two new User Environment Variables (`OCI_LIB64` and `TNS_NAMES`) and assign their respective directory paths.
    + **Note:** If you have a `tnsnames.ora` file, you must copy it to the directory specified by the `TNS_NAMES` environment variable.

Following successful installation and configuration, you should be able to use `RTools` to build `Roracle` from source...

In R, run: 
```
install.packages("path/to/ROracle.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
